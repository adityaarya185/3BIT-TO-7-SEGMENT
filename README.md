# 3BIT-TO-7-SEGMENT
Overview:
The 3-Bit to 7-Segment Display Converter is a digital circuit designed to convert 3-bit binary inputs into the corresponding 7-segment display output. Additionally, this project includes the display of the two's complement of the input binary number, enhancing its functionality.

Features:
3-Bit Input: Accepts a 3-bit binary input, allowing representation of numbers in the range 0-7.

7-Segment Output: Generates the appropriate combination of signals to display the corresponding decimal digit on a 7-segment display.

Two's Complement Display: Computes and displays the two's complement of the input binary number for a comprehensive visual representation.

Modular Design: The converter is designed with modularity in mind, facilitating easy integration into larger digital systems.
